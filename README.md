# openai-rails

- This is a web application that allows users to generate a DALL-E image based on a given prompt. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate a text response to the prompt, and then uses that response as an input to generate an image using OpenAI's DALL-E image generation API. The application is built using the Ruby on Rails framework and includes a user interface that allows users to enter a prompt, generate an image based on that prompt, and view the resulting image along with the text response. The application requires an OpenAI API key, which must be provided by the user in order to use the application.
